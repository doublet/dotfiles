# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.
I cloned this repo in `~/.dotfiles` but any directory will do.

After cloning, you can run `./setup.sh`. This will setup all the dotfiles.

## Assumptions

* `zsh` is assumed to be your shell, but it will work with `bash` too. Just skip `oh-my-zsh`. However, a `.bashrc` is not included at the moment.
* `xmonad` is assumed to be your window manager, but others will work too. Just ignore the `command not fount: xmonad` or comment out `xmonad --recompile`
